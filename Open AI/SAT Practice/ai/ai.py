        Your job is to **intuitively explain** the question and answer choices using the information below. The correct answer and explanations for each choice are already given.

        Follow these instructions strictly:
        - Start explaining right away. Do **not** ask anything or confirm.
        - Use simple English and short sentences.
        - Explain using common life examples or comparisons a student can relate to.
        - Avoid complex words unless you define them.
        - If possible, **make the student feel like they're thinking through the problem with you**.
        - Do not repeat the question unless itâ€™s helpful.
        - For each answer choice:
            1. Rephrase it in simpler words.
            2. Clearly say if it's correct or incorrect.
            3. Give a gentle, logical explanation for why it makes sense or not.

        Keep your explanation concise:
        - Do not write more than 4-5 lines per answer choice.
        - Use bullet points or short paragraphs where helpful.
        - Do not repeat the question unless it helps clarify.
        - Avoid repeating similar points across answer choices.
